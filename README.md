# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and documentation hub for mastering Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It focuses on systematically gathering, analyzing, and defining both functional and non-functional requirements to lay a strong foundation for successful software projects.

The project simulates a real-world scenario through a case study of a booking management system, emphasizing best practices, clear documentation, and visual representations like use case diagrams. The aim is to help developers learn how to produce industry-standard requirement analysis artifacts that align with business and user goals.
